            <h2>Pi Network First Airdrop</h2>
            <p>
                The official Pi Network has reached 2 million pioneers! 
                To get closer to the mainnet and activate and attract more pioneers, 
                they will be holding an airdrop, awarding a total of 614π/pioneer 
                prizes to those who successfully complete KYC. The future looks very 
                exciting as the Pi community continues to build the Web3 Pi ecosystem 
                full of amazing apps and utilities on top of the Pi browser. Let’s get 
                the job done right and do everything we can to support this exciting 
                development.
